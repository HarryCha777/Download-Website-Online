# Download-Website-Online

Download Website Online is a Flask website that downloads other websites so that the users can view them even when they are offline.

After inputting the websites that the users wish to download, the website will run Python programs to copy and zip the websites into folders that the users can download and view whenever they desire.

This website utilizes HTTrack, a free and open source offline browser tool.

HTTrack can be downloaded simply by running the following Bash command on Terminal: ```sudo apt-get install httrack```
